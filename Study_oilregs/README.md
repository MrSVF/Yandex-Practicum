## Study of oil production regions of the mining company GlavRosGosNeft  

The data of oil samples in three regions were considered, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. A machine learning model has been built to determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. Possible profits and risks are analyzed using the Bootstrap technique.
